# oat-exercise: A component for a list of test-takers

## Running the example

Just clone the repository, and open `index.html` in a browser.

## Bundling / modifying the code

A bundle is included in `bin/app.js` for convenience. This can be re-built easily, though.

#### Requirements

A recent version of nodeJS (>= 10.x recommended) and Browserify.

You can install Browserify globaly with the following command:

```bash
> npm i -g browserify
```

Once this is installed, you can regenerate the bundled `bin/app.js` running the following:

```bash
> npm run build
```
